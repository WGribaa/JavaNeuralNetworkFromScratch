This is a NeuralNetwork project before I ever took my first class of DataS Science !

It's an instanciable Full Connected Neural Network made from scratch, with no external package whatsoever. A real standalone made by myself when I had not trained the slightest in Machine Learning.

The program is quite simple, as there are very few classes, and the architecture of the project is flat.

- A Matrix class that can do all the "basic" matrix calculation.
- A MnistReader class as a convenient class to decode the Mnist files.
- A NeuralNetwork class that can be instantiated with minimal parameters a fully functional Neural Network.
-  A Main Class that is ready to launch to train 50 Epochs on the whole Mnist Dataset..

it also includes the full Mnist Dataset.

Of course, it can be improved a lot ! But back then my first goal was to make it work.
With my newly acquired skills, I finally found an hour or two to fix it. 
For your information: it was working perfectly, it was  only lacking the input data normalization ! That's how important it is.

Thank you.
